# Curls

## Overview
---

An easily accessible basic resource for people looking for information about haircare methods specific to curly hair. Changes in fashion and greater acceptance of individuality mean more people are able to wear naturally curly hair in a professional environment as well as in other situations in which it would have been considered inappropriate.

Decades of straightening, blow-drying and otherwise taming or conatining curls have meant that information about curly haircare is thin on the ground, and what there is is very spread out.  This website aims to pull together all of the basic information a curly converter might need to get started, and then provide them with links for further reading should they need or want it.

Owner aims:
* Increase awareness of curly haircare
* Provide basic information on such
* Grow the curly haircare community

User aims:
* Increase knowledge
* Easily progress through basic details to more in depth information as understanding improves
* Identify hair type and porosity
* Learn where to find information specific to indentified hair type

## UX
---

### Who, What and How
This website is for individuals looking for information to help them decide whether curly haircare is for them, and if it is, identify the characteristics of their hair and what their first steps might be.

The Curls website satisfies these objectives by first presenting a summary of the information contained within the various sections of the website, before expanding on each summary with clear progression to a dedicated page. As the user works through the pages they will gain an understanding of their hair and how it is affected by products and practices before arriving at links to further learning.

### User Stories

3. As a new user, I want to learn about basic techniques that I can use right away, so that I can start putting research into action.
4. As a returning user, I want to determine my hair type and porosity, so that I can tailor the techniques I learned before.

## Features
---

### Existing Features
Uniform design across all pages in line with conventional practice.  This incorporates:
* A sticky navigation bar which collapses to hamburger menu on mobile, with the Logo on the left and a stand-out Contact item on the right.  This allows quick and easy navigation of the website.
* A footer which provides a mission statement, contact information (including pop-up contact modal), social media links and design information.  This provides a certain and familiar endpoint to every page.
* Consistent, defined design across information delivery sections of the website.  This allows intuitive use of the website through familiarity.
* Every page starts with a hero image, to elicit a positive emotional response.
* The website is designed to be bright and clean with the focus on the information itself.  This allows the user to fulfil their purpose of obtaining knowledge without distraction.
* Androgynous design is deliberately chosen as the content is traditionally seen as feminine.  This helps users who identify as other than female to feel comfortable using the site.
* Where a particular source has provided the base content for any section it is linked to in the bottom right of that section.  This allows the user to explore the information in greater detail should they wish to do so.
* Every page has at least one internal link near the bottom of the page to avoid users becoming "trapped", and to encourage them on their journey through the website.
* The footer contains a pop-up contact modal.  This allows the user to easily access help or tailored information from anywhere on the site.

#### Home
The page features a relevant full screen hero image to provide positive emotional response and visual validation that the user is in a location which meets their needs.

The page then contains very short snapshots of all of the information contained in following pages.  These sections are clearly structured to relate directly to the links in the navigation bar.  This serves multiple purposes:
1. It allows the user to quickly determine if the website contains the information they are looking for.
2. It allows the user to quickly identify which part of the website contains the information that they are looking for, and a means to navigate to it easily.

#### Science
The page also opens with a relevant hero image, though this is not quite full screen to allow "peeping" to encourage the user to scroll to the information below.

Information is presented in short, defined sections to prevent user fatigue and these are structured consistely with the sections on the home page to provide a familiar, comfortable experience.

Diagrams are used to provide a visual representation of the data provided and help facilitate understanding.

The bottom of the article contains a link to the next page in the logical progression of the website.

#### Types
This page mirrors the Science page in layout to provide a secure, intuitive experience for the user.  Sections are once again defined in short digestible chunks and supported by visual aids.  The page again, ends with a link to the next page in the sequence.

#### Actions
As with the Science and Types pages, design remains focussed on provision of information in small defined sections.  Icons are used to provide graphic relief from large bodies of text and introduce splashes of colour.  These are used in place of the diagrams shown in previous sections which do not apply here and helps to keep the consistency of design by maintaining the presence of small images amongst the body.  A link encourages the user to the next page just before the footer.

#### More Info
Still following the design of the previous pages, clear and defined information sections are provided, here also relieved by the use of icons to break up the text content.

This is where the content of the website ends, so no progression links are provided.  However, in line with the purpose of the owner to grow the community, links to external resources which provide further, more specific information are provided here with descriptions of what can be found at each.

#### Contact
A large image is shown at the top of the page to provide continuity with the rest of the website.  A contact form is provided to encourage users to engage with the community, which will help with retention rates.

### Features for Future Implementation
1. Connect contact form to email | Requires Javascript.
2. Add pages for type specific care, to be accessed via a hair type sorter | Time constraints and technical knowledge both prevent this item from progressing at this time.
3. Add pages for type specific haircare products, possibly with sponsored links | Time constraints prevent addition of more in-depth pages at this time.  Lack of industry contacts prevent the addition of sponsored links.

4. Restart Chrome.
5. In GitHub, find the [project repository](https://github.com/lilblupig/curls-ms1).
6. From the repository menu, choose the green GitPod button.
![GitPod button snip](assets/images/deploy-3.png)
7. A new GitPod workspace will open containing the project code.

#### Cloning a Project into a Local IDE
1. Navigate to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lilblupig/curls-ms1).
2. Choose the Code dropdown menu, and copy the URL.
![GitHub code download snip](assets/images/deploy-4.png)
3. Open your local IDE and then open a terminal.
4. Set the current working directory to your preferred location for the cloned project.
5. Type in "git clone " followed by the copied URL. Be sure to include a space between git clone and the url, then press enter.
6. The cloned project will be created.
